We present BEVerse, the first unified framework for 3D perception and prediction based on multicamera systems. BEVerse features
in producing spatio-temporal Birds-Eye-View (BEV) representations from multi-camera videos and jointly reasoning
about multiple tasks for vision-centric autonomous driving. We show that the
temporal information improves 3D object detection and semantic map construction, while the multi-task learning can
implicitly benefit motion prediction.
